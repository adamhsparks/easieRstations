The goal of easieRstations is to provide wEAther ShinY (EASY) selection of GSOD weather station locations through a [leaflet](https://cran.r-project.org/package=leaflet) driven [shiny](https://cran.r-project.org/package=shiny) interface to download selected weather stations' data using [GSODR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=GSODR) or [bomrang](https://cran.r-project.org/package=bomrang). easieRstations is based on the excellent work of Dr. Fabio Veronesi, [Shiny App to access NOAA data](https://r-video-tutorial.blogspot.com/2019/02/shiny-app-to-access-noaa-data.html).
